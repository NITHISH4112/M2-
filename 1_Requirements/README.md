# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT
 The direct current (DC) motor has already established itself as a popular driving configuration for a wide range of applications. DC motors' ease of control and good performance will ensure that the number of applications that use them continues to rise in the future.A motor speed controller's job is to take a signal that represents the desired speed and operate the motor at that speed. When a power source is limited by resistive load, pulse width modulation is utilised to reduce the overall load without causing a loss.
# INTODUCTION
 DC motors have a wide range of properties and are often utilized in variable-speed drives. DC motors provide a high starting torque and can be controlled across a wide range of speeds. Making a controller to control the speed of a DC motor at the required speed is critical. In today's industrial world, DC motors play an important role. Several sorts of applications exist in which the load on the DC motor fluctuates throughout a speed range. These applications may necessitate high-speed control accuracy and responsiveness.DC motors are ideal for belt-driven applications and applications requiring a large level of torque. Fuel pump control, electronic steering control, engine control, and electric vehicle control are all examples of traction in trains and automobiles. There are a variety of applications in the aerospace industry, such as centrifuges, pumps, robotic arm controls, gyroscope controls, and so on. Closed-loop control is commonly utilised for precise servosystem speed control.
 # PRINCIPLE
  The microprocessor, which controls the motor speed and generates pulses of varied width for pulse width modulation, is at the heart of the speed controller system.       Push buttons are used to modify the motor's speed.
 # COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES
 *ATMEGA 32,
 *3 Pushbuttons,
 *3 Resistor, 
 *DC motor with BJT transistor.
 # ADVANTAGES
  Protection against short circuits
  High efficiency and quiet operation over a wide speed range
 # DISADVANTAGES
  If ourÂ application necessitates adjusting the motor's speed below the normal range, an armature controlled method may be the better option. Field-controlled DC motors can only run at speeds higher than normal. Lower torque might also be a result of higher speeds.
